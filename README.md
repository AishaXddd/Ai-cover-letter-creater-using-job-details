This project is an AI-powered Cover Letter Generator designed to streamline and personalize the job application process. By leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) through APIs such as OpenAI GPT, this tool allows users to generate custom cover letters tailored to specific roles, companies, and personal skillsets with minimal effort.

The user inputs key details such as their name, position applied for, relevant experiences, achievements, and the target company. Based on this information, the backend constructs a dynamic prompt and sends it to the LLM, which returns a polished and structured cover letter. The user can then copy, modify, or export the letter for use in their applications.

This tool addresses a common challenge faced by job seekers: writing personalized cover letters for each application. It reduces time and stress, while still producing high-quality and relevant content. The project showcases practical use of AI integration in real-world applications and serves as an example of combining frontend, backend, and AI APIs into a cohesive solution.

It is built using a Python Flask backend, connected to a lightweight HTML/CSS frontend. The application can be deployed on local or cloud environments, making it accessible and scalable for wider use.
