Project Overview: AI-Powered Cover Letter Generator

This project introduces an intelligent Cover Letter Generator that simplifies and personalizes the job application process using the power of AI. By integrating Large Language Models (LLMs) such as OpenAI's GPT through API calls, the tool helps users craft tailored cover letters with minimal manual effort.

Users provide essential details like their name, the job title they’re applying for, key experiences, notable achievements, and the target company. The system processes this input, dynamically builds a prompt, and sends it to the LLM. The result is a professionally written, role-specific cover letter that users can review, edit, or export for submission.

The tool addresses a common hurdle for job seekers—writing unique cover letters for each job. It streamlines this task, saving time while maintaining a high standard of quality and personalization.

Built using a Python Flask backend and a simple HTML/CSS frontend, the application is lightweight, user-friendly, and can be deployed either locally or in the cloud. It stands as a practical example of how AI can be integrated into everyday applications to improve efficiency and user experience.
